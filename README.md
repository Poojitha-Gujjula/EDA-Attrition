# EDA-Attrition
univariate, bivariate and multivariate Analysis
The key to success in an organisation is the ability to attract and retain top talents. It is vital for the Human Resource (HR) Department to identify the factors that keep employees and those which prompt them to leave. Companies could do more to prevent the loss of good people.

This project is based on a hypothetical dataset on HR Employee attrition and performance. It has various data points describing employees characteristics, and labelled with whether they are still in the company or whether they have gone to work somewhere else (supervised learning). Machine Learning can help to understand and determine how these factors relate to workforce attrition.

Which are the key factors leading to employee attrition?
